      "question": "When is the best time to fly to Costa Rica?",
      "answer": "Costa Rica is great to visit all year round, as confirmed by our tourists. There are pros and cons in both seasons. The dry season (also called summer here) lasts from December to April inclusive, there may be winds, almost no rain, which is convenient as you can travel from morning to evening without fearing sudden showers. Of course, in the dry season, the vegetation is drier, especially in the Pacific region. Hotel prices are higher in summer (from December to April) due to the high season. In the wet season (from May to November inclusive), accommodation prices decrease, there are fewer tourists, so it is much more comfortable to visit the most popular tourist places. Rain falls in the central valley and on the Pacific coast from around 1 pm to 4 pm, approximately. It is advisable to plan all major activities in the morning. There is a siesta at lunchtime, and by evening, you can usually relax on the beach again. Also, the rain is warm, and tourists perceive it as an adventure. In the Caribbean area (Atlantic Ocean), there is no rainy season as such, and rainy days are unpredictable and also do not interfere with relaxation."

    "11": {
      "question": "How much money do you need for a trip to Costa Rica?",
      "answer": "Of course, everyone has a different income level and preferences regarding the level of service. But you can roughly calculate the cost of a trip to Costa Rica.\nYou will spend on hotels here on average $100 per person per day, there are hotels cheaper and much more expensive, but on average, it turns out like this. \nThe average bill in a restaurant for two is $50-70. If you order a traditional hearty dish, casado, for lunch, it will be even cheaper (about $10 per person), and a drink will cost around $3-5. \nExcursions to national parks cost approximately $17, and tours like 'rafting' or 'canopy,' as well as private tourist parks, from $45 to $75. \nCar rental will cost you $120-160 + about $50 for gas per day. There are no addresses in Costa Rica, which is why we usually recommend booking a car with a driver-guide in advance, as it is cheaper and much more reliable. The services of a driver-guide cost approximately $250 per day with a car and gasoline. \nSouvenirs cost about $20-30."
    },
    "12": {
      "question": "Why do you need an organized tour of Costa Rica?",
      "answer": "Bus service is not developed, and there is no other public transportation! Everything is perfect and untouched by people\nIt's easier to do somewhere in Europe or in Thailand, where tourism is very developed and organized. Costa Rica, however, is beautiful precisely because it is not very developed logistically. Everything is exclusive for you – no people on beaches and waterfalls, and national parks resemble a Jurassic period park, filled with wildlife, not tourists.\nMany amazing places in Costa Rica are not marked on the map\nIn Costa Rica, many of the most interesting routes and tourist spots are not marked on the map. At the same time, it is quite expensive and difficult to rent a car. We are ready to take care of your transfer!\nIs it really true that there are no addresses in Costa Rica?\nIt's hard to believe, but it is often difficult to find something in Costa Rica due to the lack of exact addresses, to which we are so accustomed. Only the main streets are marked on maps, without indicating house numbers. Car rental will cost you $120-160 + about $50 for gas per day. There are no addresses in Costa Rica, which is why we usually recommend booking a car with a driver-guide in advance, as it is cheaper and much more reliable. The services of a driver-guide cost approximately $250 per day with a car and gasoline. \nWe know the best routes!\nMany recommendations taken from websites or received from bloggers are not optimal. We have been taking tourists around Costa Rica for a long time and rely on the experience and needs of our tourists who have visited us. Therefore, our basic tours are built precisely according to your needs, and we can also adjust sets of routes developed by us to your dates or terms."
